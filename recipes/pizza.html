<p>Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with olive oil and refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours.</p> <p>Be sure to use a big enough container to allow dough to rise.</p>

<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Make the pizzas: Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to using.</p>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees F (288 degrees C). Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.</p>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Prepare the first pizza: Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and stretch gradually until about 14 inches in diameter, or about the size of the pizza stone. Place on the floured peel.</p>

<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon oregano and 1/8 teaspoon pepper over the top.</p> <p>Randomly arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes over the pizza, leaving some empty areas, then drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil over top.</p>

<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>With a quick back and forth jerk, make sure dough will release from the peel easily.</p> <p>Place the tip of the peel at the back of the preheated pizza stone, and remove the peel so that the pizza is left on the stone.</p>
<h4>Step 9</h4>
<p>Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes.</p>
<h4>Step 10</h4>
<p>Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then slide off the peel onto a work surface.</p> <p>Sprinkle 1/2 of the basil leaves randomly over the pizza. Cut into wedges and serve.</p>
